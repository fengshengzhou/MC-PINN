# MC-PINN
MC-PINN (Monte Carlo–Physics-Informed Neural Network) combines Monte Carlo sampling with physical constraints to predict fatigue crack growth life. It augments limited a–N data using statistical porosity distributions and embeds Paris’ law and monotonicity constraints into the loss, improving accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.
